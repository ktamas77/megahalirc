# MegaHAL IRC Chat Bot
MegaHAL was and made its debut in the 1998 Loebner Prize Contest. Like many chatbots, the intent is for MegaHAL to appear as a human fluent in a natural language. This small JAVA iRC BOT will bring MegaHAL functionality to any iRC chatroom or private conversation channel.

#### How to install
1. Download & install MegaHAL
2. Edit variables (irc channel, bot name, megahal path, etc) in `Halacska.java` (Class `Halacska`).
3. Run Halacska.java
4. Private message your chatbot in the given IRC channel and type 'help' for the list of the available control commands
5. Enjoy. =)
